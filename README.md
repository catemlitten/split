About Split
--------------------------

The idea behind Split was based upon the idea of twins who were separated yet somehow made to walk the same path. As each player moves their twin moves in exactly the same direction. The end goal is for both twins to survive together.

How to play
------------
In the game_code folder run 'main.py'.

Gameplay is intuitive using the 'up' arrow key to move up, 'right' arrow key to move right, and so on. If a player prefers they may also use the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys to move 'up', 'left', 'down', and 'right' respectively.
